TSAE2
=====
In terms of development, this application can be built using ant, but can also be loaded using the BlueJ IDE. 

The purpose of this application is to communicate with an Arduino Microcontroller which is using a series of differentiator circuits to determine when a sinusoidal input's derivatives are equal to zero. This data is recorded, processed and reconstructed using a Taylor Series Approximation.
